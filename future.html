      <h2>Possible Shift?</h2>
        <h3>NBA Internship</h3>
          <p>Although my dream in life is to be an on air personality, many of my trusted mentors have told me to get an intership at a corporate position. It is good practice to see how the business works both on and off camera. For this reason, I have applied to an internship at the <abbr title="National Basketball Association">NBA</abbr>.</p>

      <h3 id="Ustadshow">UStadium Show</h3>
        <p>My future with UStadium is on pause at the moment. Due to some behind the scenes issues, we are forced to look for a new cohost for The Sonny Carton Show.</p>
        <p>Once a reliable co-host is found expect the UStadium content to start back up. The show will focus on all things sports, with a special focus on the Big Apple.</p>

    <h2>Upcoming WFAN Show</h2>
    <h3>Carton & Russo 2</h3>
    <p>I am thrilled to announce that on December 22, <time datetime="2022">2022</time>, I will be doing the second ever Carton and Russo radio show. I am hosting the 2 hour show with Colin Russo and we'll try to do better than we did two years ago.</p>

      <p>Tensions will certainly be flaring during our show due to a random coincidence. In a twist of fate, Colin's Jaguars, and my Jets play each other on Thursday Night Football, the night of our show together.</p>
      <p>Expect us to get into that game, everything that has happened in the <abbr title="Major League Baseball">MLB</abbr> offseason, and anything else NY sports.</p>

    <h2>Call Me Crazy</h2>
    <h3>Lifelong Dream</h3>
    <p>Everyone has always asked me what I want to be in life. I have a dream that many people may say is crazy.</p>

    <p>Ever since I was the boy sitting in that chair above, I have thought that there's something missing in the world of sports broadcasting. I plan to demote my life to finding what's missing.</p>
    <p>Once I find the missing link, whatever that may be, I will pursue that career until I am the best to ever do it.</p>
