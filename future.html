      <h2>Possible Shift?</h2>
        <h3>NBA Internship</h3>
          <p>Although my dream in life is to be an on air personality, many of my trusted mentors have told me to get an intership at a corporate position. It is good practice to see how the business works both on and off camera. For this reason, I have applied to an internship at the NBA.</p>

      <h3>UStadium Show</h3>
        <p>My future with UStadium is on pause at the moment. Due to some behind the scenes issues, we are forced to look for a new cohost for The Sonny Carton Show. Once a reliable co-host is found expect the UStadium content to start back up.</p>

    <h2>Upcoming WFAN Show</h2>
    <p>I am thrilled to announce that on December 22, 2022, I will be doing the second ever Carton and Russo radio show. I am hosting the 2 hour show with Colin Russo and we'll try to do better than we did two years ago.</p>

    <h2>Call Me Crazy</h2>
    <p>Everyone always asks me what I want to be in life. Many of them assume I want to be on radio because that's what I've done in the past. However, I havea a dream that some people may say is crazy. Ever since I was the boy sitting in that chair, I thought something hasn't been created yet in the world of sports broadcasting. Once I find the missing link, I will pursue that career until I am the best to ever do it.</p>
