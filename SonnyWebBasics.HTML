    <h1>Who Is SonnyCarton?</h1>

    <p>My name is SonnyCarton and I'm a student at the University of Miami who loves the New York Knicks</p>

    <p>I started loving the Knicks ever since I grew up in New York</p>


    <h2>New York Knicks History</h2>

    <p>The Knicks became an official NBA team in 1949. They were one of the founding members of the BAA, which ended up merging with the NBL to form the NBA</p>

    <p>Their first ever coach was named Joe Lapchick and their leading scorer was Carl Braun, a Point Guard from Brooklyn</p>
