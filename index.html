          <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>About Me</h3>

              <p>My name is Sonny Carton. Ever since I was born I was obssesed with sports. From watching and talking about sports to playing them I could never get enough.</p>

              <p>I have three siblings, but my younger brother Lucky is who I really developed my love of sports alongside. He was two years younger than me, but that gap was small enough that we competed against each other in everything. Back then, give us a ball, and somewhere to play, and you wouldn't hear from us for the rest of the day.</p>

              <p>I was born on May 31, <time datetime="2002">2002</time> in a small town in Pennslyvania called Huntingdon Valley.</p>

              <p>I lived here up until I was 9 years old and my family and I moved to New York City. It was there in NY that my passsion took off and my journey into the world of broadcasting truly began.</p>
