    <h2>Broadcast Questions?</h2>
    <h3>How Did It All Start?</h3>
    <p>As mentioned, with my dad working in the field of broadcasting, my ear has always been tuned for the mic. I started off arguing different sports takes with my friends. It was at this point that I realized that I spend most of my time watching and breaking down professional sports.</p>
    <p>If I'm not going to be a professional athlete, might as well try to make money talking about those who are. From here I started sitting in my room with my phone recording my voice. I would give my opinion on simple things. Such as the outcome of a Knicks game that night, or what my travel soccer team needs to do to play better.</p>


    <h3>Why Broadcasting?</h3>
    <p>Growing up making these recordings, it was only a matter of time before my dad wanted to have me on his show. It started off simple. He'd ask me which of two teams I thought was going to win and leave it at that. The more oppurtunities I got the more comfortable on the air I felt. And the more comfortable I felt the more I decided that sports broadcasting is what I want to do.</p>


    <h3>Hardest Challenges?</h3>
    <p>The hardest part about being a successful broadcaster is the amount of people that are in the business. There are only so many top companies, and each of those companies only has a limited number of on air talent.</p>
    <p>Most people expect that those getting paid to talk sports are always right, or at least extremely knowledgable about the sports they cover. However, in the world of sports broadcasting accuracy is not the goal. Entertainment is.</p>



    <h3>How Will I Be Different?</h3>
    <p>Many current broadcasters fall under the category of a "shock jock", meaning they say outlandish things to illicit a response from the audience. However, my plan is to be able to combine by deep passion and understanding of each league with the entertainment value that a "shock jock" can provide.</p>
    <p>All of my idols and mentors in the industry have made one thing extremely clear. In order to succeed you have to be you. That doesn't mean exactly as you would behave talking to friends. It simply means you can't copy anyone elses style. You have to find what works best for you and run with it.</p>

    <h3>Best Experiences?</h3>
    <p>On the right, you will see examples of my favorite moments on the air. Both the Interns after Hours and the Carton & Russo show were on WFAN. These moments are irreplacable due to the audience they command but that's not where my experience ends. </p>
    <p>A smaller scale media company UStadium, has given me the platform to create and spread content. First I did a pre-taped show with former <abbr title="National Football League">NFL</abbr> player Damon "Snacks" Harrison. In the example on the right we had current All-Pro <abbr title="National Football League">NFL</abbr> safety Darius Slay on.</p>
    <p>At this point the goal is to get as much experience and exposure as possible and both of these outlets have been essential in my pursuit to become a professional broadcaster.

    <h3>Favorite Throwback Picture?</h3>
    <p>This is one of my all time favorite pictures. It reminds me of an awesome time at the SuperBowl and gives me a goal to strive towards in my own professional career.</p>

          <h3>WFAN</h3>
          <article>
            <h4>Interns After Hours</h4>
            <p>Interns After Hours was a one time show ran exclusively by WFAN interns. Matthew Levy and I hosted the show in the heart of the <abbr title="Major Leauge Baseball">MLB</abbr> playoff push. You can hear one clip from the show below.</p>
            <iframe class="podvids" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/779983308?h=1ac2e5ead7&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" width="500" height="231" allow="fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="RPReplay_Final1663603051.mov"></iframe>
          </article>
            <h4>Carton & Russo</h4>
            <p>As we are both the sons of famous sports broadcasters, the program director at WFAN decided to have us team up for a show meant to give a look into the next generation of sports voices.</p>
            <iframe class="podvids" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVVq7yz_MVo?start=57" width="500" height="315" title="WFAN Permitted Video of Carton & Russo" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <article>
            <h4>Snacks & Sonny</h4>
            <p>Snacks & Sonny was a show that I hosted alongside former <abbr title="National Football League">NFL</abbr> defensive lineman Damon "Snacks" Harrison. Through Damon's connections we were able to get an interview with Darius Slay as shown in the clip below.</p>
            <iframe class="podvids" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/779983315?h=7fadaf2252&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" width="500" height="284" allow="fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="RPReplay_Final1663604966"></iframe>
          </article>
            <h4>The Sonny Carton Show</h4>
            <p>Lastly, we have The Sonny Carton Show that I host by myself. The show covers all things sports and is the perfect stage for me to give my full thoughts on controversial topics and sports outcomes. Here I can devote more time to a subject than I would be able to on the radio.</p>
