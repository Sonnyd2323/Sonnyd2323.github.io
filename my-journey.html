    <h2>Broadcast Questions?</h2>
    <h3>How did it all start?</h3>
    <p>As mentioned, with my dad working in the field of broadcasting, my ear has always been tuned for the mic. I started off arguing different sports takes with my friends. It was at this point that I realized that I spend most of my time watching and breaking down professional sports.</p>
    <p>If I'm not going to be a professional athlete, might as well try to make money talking about those who are. From here I started sitting in my room with my phone recording my voice. I would give my opinion on simple things. Such as the outcome of a Knicks game that night, or what my travel soccer team needs to do to play better.</p>
    <p>At first I wouldn't even post the recordings. I would just play them back for myself to see how my voice and thoughts have changed over time.</p>

    <h3>Why Broadcasting?</h3>
    <p>Growing up making these recordings, it was only a matter of time before my dad wanted to have me on his show. It started off simple. He'd ask me which of two teams I thought was going to win and leave it at that. The more oppurtunities I got the more comfortable on the air I felt. And the more comfortable I felt the more I decided that sports broadcasting is what I want to do.</p>


    <h3>Hardest Challenges</h3>
    <p>The hardest part about being a successful broadcaster is the amount of people that are in the business. There are only so many top companies, and each of those companies only has a limited number of on air talent.</p>
    <p>Most people expect that those getting paid to talk sports are always right, or at least extremely knowledgable about the sports they cover. However, in the world of sports broadcasting accuracy is not the goal. Entertainment is.</p>


    <h3>Why Broadcasting?</h3>
    <p>Growing up, my dad had the coolest job any sports fan can have. He gets paid to talk to professional athletes about games made for children. So as someone who loved sports, it seemed natural that I'd end up doing the same thing.
